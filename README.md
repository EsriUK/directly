# directly
Visualise data beyond the map.

directly is a concept app as a result of an internal JS challenge ran at Esri UK (created by Sean McGee).

The idea of directly is to showcase a style of mapping application which allows for on-screen alerts when data is nearby/close to the user. 

It creates greater awareness of the data and gives users an insight beyond their current extent.



It's still very early/concept stages and there's many areas where would like to improve. For example:

Map scaling, map rotation, moving points, live data and point clustering.

For more ideas and where to submit your own, please visit the issues tab on this github repo!

Any feedback on this is appreciated.
